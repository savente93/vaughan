# vaughan
`vaughan` is a rust library that implements a bunch of common scientific procedures on top of Polars. Currently it is just to see how the implementation would compare in terms of ease of implementation as well as performance when compared to something like `ndarray`, but given that Polars is really cool, I hope it has a bright future. I'm also implementing it to provide a more easily testable base for `svalbard`. `vaughan` is named after [Dorothy Vaughan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Vaughan) one of the black women that worked at NASA as human computers in the 1940's and 1950's and were instrumental in the moon landing.
